# Day 1 – SQL Practice (Data Analyst Roadmap)

This folder is your **Day 1 SQL mini-project**.

You will practice on a **simple e-commerce dataset** with three tables:

- `customers` – customer details
- `orders` – orders placed by customers
- `payments` – payments made for orders

> **Assumed DB:** MySQL (or MariaDB).  
> If you use PostgreSQL, you’ll need to tweak some syntax (like `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `CURDATE()`, `LIMIT`).

---

## Files

- `practice.sql`  
  Creates the database, tables, and inserts sample data.

- `challenges.sql`  
  Contains the **problem statements** as comments and **empty query blocks** for you to fill.

- `solutions.sql`  
  Same problems, but with **completed queries**.

- `nots.md`  
  (Day 1 notes) Short theory recap + key tricks you should remember.

## How to Use

1. **Create DB + Sample Data**

   Open your MySQL client (CLI, Workbench, DBeaver, etc.) and run:

   ```sql
   SOURCE /path/to/practice.sql;
